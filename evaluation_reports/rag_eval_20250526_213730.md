Chunk 1 (source: NetUnicorn Full Script Structure Example): 

```
A typical NetUnicorn script involves: 
1. Importing necessary classes (e.g., `RemoteClient`, `Pipeline`, `SleepTask`). 
2. Defining NetUnicorn connection parameters (endpoint, login, password) - these will be injected by the RAG. 
3. Creating a `RemoteClient` instance. 
4. Creating a `Pipeline` and adding tasks using `.then()`. 
5. Getting and selecting nodes (e.g., `client.get_nodes().take(1)`). 
6. Defining an `experiment_name` (string). 
7. Deleting any pre-existing experiment with the same name (using try-except). 
8. Preparing the experiment: `client.prepare_experiment(pipeline, nodes, experiment_name)`. 
9. Starting the experiment: `client.start_execution(experiment_name)`. 
10. Waiting for completion: `client.wait_for_experiment(experiment_name)`. 
11. Retrieving and printing results: `client.get_experiment_status(experiment_name).execution_result`.

Chunk 2 (source: NetUnicorn Library: utils Tasks): 

```
General utility tasks from `netunicorn.library.tasks.utils`:\\n- `utils.network.PortKnock(ip: str, port: int)`: Attempts a single TCP connection (a "knock") to the specified `ip` and `port`. Does not return success/failure of the knock itself, always returns 0.\\n- `utils.sleep.RandomSleepTask(seconds_min: int, seconds_max: int)`: A TaskDispatcher that returns a `SleepTask` (from `basic.py`) which will sleep for a random duration between `seconds_min` and `seconds_max` (inclusive).
```

Chunk 3 (source: NetUnicorn Library: basic.py Tasks): 

```
Tasks from `netunicorn.library.tasks.basic`:\\n- `DummyTask()`: A simple task whose `run()` method returns `True`. Useful for testing pipeline functionality.\\n- `SleepTask(seconds: int)`: Causes the execution to pause for the specified number of `seconds`. Example: `SleepTask(10)` will sleep for 10 seconds.

Similar to the Vimeo watcher, it can watch for a fixed `duration` or attempt to watch until the end by checking player state via JavaScript. Uses `YouTubeIFrameStatus` enum for player states.\\nAll these watchers are TaskDispatchers that delegate to Linux-specific implementations which handle Selenium and Xvfb setup (typically requiring `chromium`, `chromium-driver`, `xvfb`, `selenium`).

It sends QoE metrics (player state, quality changes, periodic stats) to the specified `qoe_server_address:qoe_server_port`. `duration` specifies watch time (None for full video). `quality` can request a specific resolution. `report_time` is the interval for sending periodic stats (in ms). (Dispatcher for Linux implementation with extensive Selenium/Chrome/extension setup requirements). The underlying watcher logic is in `watcher.py`.

## 10. Utility (Port Knock)
Prompt: Create a script that performs a port knock on IP '10.0.0.1' to port 12345 from one node.

Chunk 1 (source: NetUnicorn Library: utils Tasks): 

```
General utility tasks from `netunicorn.library.tasks.utils`:\\n- `utils.network.PortKnock(ip: str, port: int)`: Attempts a single TCP connection (a "knock") to the specified `ip` and `port`. Does not return success/failure of the knock itself, always returns 0.\\n- `utils.sleep.RandomSleepTask(seconds_min: int, seconds_max: int)`: A TaskDispatcher that returns a `SleepTask` (from `basic.py`) which will sleep for a random duration between `seconds_min` and `seconds_max` (inclusive).
```

Chunk 2 (source: NetUnicorn Full Script Structure Example): 

```
A typical NetUnicorn script involves: 
1. Importing necessary classes (e.g., `RemoteClient`, `Pipeline`, `SleepTask`). 
2. Defining NetUnicorn connection parameters (endpoint, login, password) - these will be injected by the RAG. 
3. Creating a `RemoteClient` instance. 
4. Creating a `Pipeline` and adding tasks using `.then()`. 
5. Getting and selecting nodes (e.g., `client.get_nodes().take(1)`). 
6. Defining an `experiment_name` (string). 
7. Deleting any pre-existing experiment with the same name (using try-except). 
8. Preparing the experiment: `client.prepare_experiment(pipeline, nodes, experiment_name)`. 
9. Starting the experiment: `client.start_execution(experiment_name)`. 
10. Waiting for completion: `client.wait_for_experiment(experiment_name)`. 
11. Retrieving and printing results: `client.get_experiment_status(experiment_name).execution_result`.
Example snippet for lifecycle:
```python
# ... imports, client, pipeline, nodes defined ...
```
