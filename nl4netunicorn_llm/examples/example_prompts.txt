1. Basic Task:
   - "Generate a NetUnicorn script that selects two available nodes and makes each of them sleep for 15 seconds. Then, print the results."

2. File System & Flags:
   - "Create a script that runs on one node. First, it should get the current kernel version and set it as a flag named 'kernel_version'. Then, it should check the free disk space in '/tmp' and set that as a flag named 'tmp_free_space'. Finally, retrieve and print both flags."

3. Network Capture:
   - "Write a NetUnicorn script to start a tcpdump capture on one node, saving to 'capture.pcap' for 30 seconds, then stop the capture. After stopping, use SendData to make 'capture.pcap' available."

4. Measurement (Ookla Speedtest & Analysis):
   - "Develop a script that runs an Ookla speedtest on a single node. After the speedtest, use the OoklaSpeedtestAnalysis task to analyze the results. Print the analysis summary."

5. Measurement (Ping):
   - "Generate a script that pings 'google.com' 10 times from one node, with a 0.5 second interval. Print the full ping results."

6. Data Transfer & Preprocessing (Hypothetical Chain):
   - "Create a script for two nodes. Node 1 runs an `ExecuteShellCommand` to create a dummy text file named 'mydata.txt' with content 'Hello NetUnicorn'. Node 1 then uses `SendData` to make 'mydata.txt' available. Node 2 uses `FetchData` to get 'mydata.txt', then runs `ExecuteShellCommand` to print its content using `cat mydata.txt`."

7. Video Watching (Simple YouTube):
   - "Write a script to watch the YouTube video 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ' for 20 seconds on one node. Use the simple YouTube watcher."

8. File Upload (File.io):
   - "Generate a script that first creates a small text file named 'upload_test.txt' with some sample text on one node. Then, upload this file to file.io with a 1-day expiration. Print the file.io link from the result."

9. Network Attack (LAND Attack - USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION AND ONLY ON ISOLATED TEST NETWORKS):
   - "Generate a script to perform a LAND attack against IP '192.168.1.100' using source port 1337 and destination port 80 on one node. (Warning: Only for use in controlled, isolated test environments)."

10. Utility (Port Knock):
    - "Create a script that performs a port knock on IP '10.0.0.1' to port 12345 from one node."
