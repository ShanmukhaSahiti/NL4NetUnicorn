Generate a NetUnicorn script that selects two available nodes and makes each of them sleep for 15 seconds. Then, print the results.
Generate a script that uses ShellCommand to ping 'google.com' 10 times from one node, with a 0.5 second interval. Print the full ping results. Ensure `is_successful` is imported from `returns.pipeline`.
Create a script that runs on one node. First, it should get the current kernel version and set it as a flag named 'kernel_version'. Then, it should check the free disk space in '/tmp' and set that as a flag named 'tmp_free_space'. Finally, retrieve and print both flags.
